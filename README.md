# dapp-30
This repositories includes will include a portfolio of smart contract mini projects that I completed to learn the fundametals of developing Solidity smart contracts.

Package dependencies to run the projects
- Truffle
- Ganache
- WebPack

How to run each of the project folders
  - clone/download the code within each folder
  - run truffle

# day 1 - Simple Smart Contract
This inital folder is focused on getting reoriented with the formalities of setting up a smart contract and deploying in remix.

# day 2 - Hello World

# day 3 - Simple Storage

# day 4 - Advanced Storage
This project builds off of the previous day with an additional nuance. Within the smart contract, the "data" variable is an array of numbers,  Consequently, upon clicking submit, the entered value will be appended to the array instead of replacing the single value.
In this project there were some additional achievements made with the front-end portion. Instead of connecting the dapp to the local ganache blockchain instance in the background, I connected the metamask instance directly in the browser to more closely simulate real world interactions.
